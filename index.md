# Welcome to my Homeserver! Currently WIP.

Welcome! Since the pandemic I've been wanting to develop a storage solution for my media, backups and to host applications outside of my internal network. I've worked as a DevOps Engineer so I wanted to "practice what I preach" and have a simple solution for deployment and configuration. Before I being I want to go over my current deployment for my NAS and storage solution. 

## System Specifications
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Docker-ce with Docker Compose
- zfs currently 3 x 4tb HDDs in Raidz1
